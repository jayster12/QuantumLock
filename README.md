- [x] Ability to delete password entries

    - NOTE: Weird problem with this in previous versions due to the HTML. When you would click delete password for the first password entry, it would send empty POST request to `/add-password` endpoint & add a blank password. Fixed by moving the `div` around for the `/add-password` element 


- [x] When adding password entries, check to see if the entry is empty before allowing it to be submitted. It must have at least a username and password inputted. Otherwise, don't accept the POST request
